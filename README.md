### Setup
Before running, please go to the CS61Lab3PartA folder and install the packages using: ```npm install```


To set up the tables, in the CS61Lab3PartA folder, please start with the following command: ```node MMSetup.js```


This command will set up all of the files in our database and insert some basic data for testing.


Now, please ```cd ..``` to go to the outer directory.


### Functionalities
QUIT: A user may quit out of the program at any time using the following command:


```quit```


#### Author functionality:


REGISTER: A user may register an author using the following command:


```register author [username] [fname] [lname] [email] "[mailing address]" "[affiliation]"```


LOGIN: A user may login to an author account using the following command:


```login author [username]```


This will also be followed by the output from the "Status" command.


STATUS: A user may show the status of his or her author account, which will provide a summary of the number of manuscripts in various phases. Please note that using the "List" command will show specific information about manuscripts with which the author is associated as a primary author. An author may see status using the following command:


```status```


LIST: This command shows specific information about the manuscripts with which the author is associated as a primary author. An author may see his or her list of manuscripts using the following command:


```list```


SUBMIT: This command allows authors to submit manuscripts for which he or she is the primary author. This command provides the title, the author's current affiliation (a string), RICode representing the subject area, optional additional authors, and the document itself (we made this a string as per our discussion in class). The author affiliation will be updated to reflect the affiliation in this manuscript.  An author may submit a manuscript with the following command:


```submit [title] [affiliation] [RICode] [author2] [author3] [author4] [documentString]```


RETRACT: This command allows authors to retract a manuscript from the system. This command asks if the author is sure.  If the answer is yes, then the reviews and manuscript will be retracted from the system. An author may retract a manuscript with the following command:


```retract [manuscriptID]```


#### Editor functionality:


REGISTER: A user may register an editor using the following command:


```register editor [username] [fname] [lname]```


LOGIN: A user may login to an editor account using the following command:


```login author [username]```


This will also be followed by the output from the "Status" command.


STATUS: A user may show the status of his or her editor account, which will provide a summary of the number of manuscripts in various phases. Please note that using the "List" command will show specific information about manuscripts with which the editor is associated. An editor may see status using the following command:


```status```


LIST: This command shows specific information about the manuscripts with which the editor is associated. An editor may see his or her list of manuscripts using the following command:


```list```

ASSIGN: This command assigns a manuscript to a reviewer to be reviewed.  This command ensures that the editor has the authority to assign the manuscript, that the reviewer is not retired, that the manuscript is not already published/typeset, and that the reviewer has an interest in the field of the manuscript.  This creates a blank review for the reviewer that the reviewer may fill out at his or her discretion.  An editor may assign a manuscript for review using the following command:


```assign [manuscriptID] [reviewerUsername]```


REJECT: This command sets the status of a manuscript to "Rejected."  This command ensures that the editor has the authority to reject the manuscript and that the manuscript is in a stage that allows it to be rejected.  Then, this command marks the time that the decision was made and sets the status of the manuscript to "Rejected."  An editor may reject a manuscript with the following command:


```reject [manuscriptID]```


ACCEPT: This command sets the status of a manuscript to "Accepted."  This command ensures that the editor has the authority to accept the manuscript, that the manuscript is in the appropriate stage to be accepted and that the manuscript has at least 3 completed reviews associated with it.  Then, the command marks that time that the decision was made and sets the status of the manuscript to "Accepted.""  An editor may accept a manuscript with the following command:


```accept [manuscriptID]```


TYPESET: This command sets the status of a manuscript to "Typeset."  This command ensures that the editor has the authority to typeset the manuscript and that the manuscript is in the appropriate stage to be typeset.  Then, the command updates the status to "Typeset" and stores the number of pages that the manuscript will occupy.  An editor may typeset a manuscript with the following command:


```typeset [manuscriptID] [pagesOccupied]```


SCHEDULE: This command sets the status of a manuscript to "Scheduled" and assigns it to the appropriate issue.  This command ensures that the year and issue number the editor enters are valid (no past years, no invalid issue numbers), that the editor has the authority to schedule the manuscript, that the manuscript is in the appropriate stage to be scheduled (typeset), that the issue in question has not already been published, that the issue in question exists (if not, then it is created) and that adding the manuscript would not exceed the 100-page limit per issue.  Then, the command updates the status of the manuscript to "Scheduled" and updates the issue number and year.  Unlike the command provided to us in the spec, we decided to implement this by dividing issue into its components, year and period, on the command line.  An editor may schedule a manuscript with the following command:


```schedule [manuscriptID] [Year] [Period]```


PUBLISH: This command publishes an issue and sets the status of all its manuscripts to "Published."  This command ensures that the issue exists, that it has not already been published and that the issue contains at least 1 manuscript.  Then, the command updates the print date (assumed to be the date/time that the publish decision is made because this causes the issue to be sent for publication) and updates the status of all of the manuscripts in the issue to "Published."  An editor may publish an issue with the following command:


```publish [Year] [Period]```


#### Reviewer functionality:


REGISTER: This command registers a reviewer.  We collect information about a reviewer's affiliation and email because this is one of the only opportunities to do so.  This command also assumed that users are not retired upon registration.  A user may register a reviewer using the following command:


```register reviewer [username] [fname] [lname] [email] "[affiliation]" [RICode1] [RICode2] [RICode3] ```


RESIGN: This command resigns a reviewer.  This command updates the Retired field of a user, and thanks the user, and logs out the user.  The reviews that a resigned reviewer has not completed will not appear in the tallies for valid reviews to determine manuscript approval.  In addition, the user will not be able to login after resigning.  A reviewer may resign using the following command:


```retire```


LOGIN: A user may login to a reviewer account using the following command:


```login reviewer [reviewerUsername]```


This will also be followed by the output from the "Status" command.


STATUS: A user may show the status of his or her reviewer account, which will provide a summary of the number of manuscripts in various phases associated with the reivewer. Please note that using the "List" command will show specific information about manuscripts with which the reviewer is associated. A reviewer may see status using the following command:


```status```


LIST: This command shows specific information about the manuscripts with which the reviewer is associated. A reviewer may see his or her list of manuscripts using the following command:


```list```


REVIEW: This command allows a reviewer to submit a review about a specific manuscript.  This command checks that the reviewer has the authority to review the manuscript and that the manuscript is under review.  The manuscript records the timestamp of the recommendation(accept/reject) and notes all the scores in the review table.  We designed this command so that a reviewer may revise his or her review.  A reviewer may review a manuscript with the following command:


```review [recommendation] [manuscriptID] [appropriateness] [clarity] [methodology] [contributionToField]```


### Testing

NOTE 1: These tests assume that our node script MMSetup.js with sample data has been run on the database prior to starting.

NOTE 2: The things in the parentheses are just what the program returned to us, but the password and IDs will likely vary depending on how many times you register a new user/your password choice.  We just included it as a reference.

Please make sure you are in the cs61-lab3partB directory and run the following command to start the program:


```python driver.py```


#### Test register functions
To test the register function, please register an editor, an author, and a reviewer.  Please note down the usernames that you use.


Editor: ```register editor devinakumar Devina Kumar``` (username: devinakumar)

Author: ```register author charlespalmer Charles Palmer charlespalmer@dartmouth.edu "1900 Hinman" "Dartmouth College"``` (username: charlespalmer)

Reviewer: ```register reviewer damiapoeso Dami Apoeso damiapoeso@dartmouth.edu "Dartmouth CS" 1 2 3``` (username: damiapoeso)


Now, using the usernames you just created, please try logging in and then logging out.

```login editor devinakumar``` and then ```logout```

```login author charlespalmer``` and then ```logout```

```login reviewer damiapoeso``` and then ```logout```


For each one, the screen should show a greeting with the first and last name (for authors, there should also be an address).  Please note that there are no manuscripts displayed because these users are not yet associated with any manuscripts.


#### Make a manuscript
To test the author submission, let us submit a new manuscript.

Log in to charlespalmer's account: ```login author charlespalmer```

Submit a manuscript: ```submit "Test Manuscript" "Dartmouth" 1 "Tina Fey" "Amy Poehler" "test.doc"```

Check the status: ```status```

Get more detailed information by using the list command: ```list```

Try submitting the manuscript again: ```submit "Test Manuscript" "Dartmouth" 1 "Tina Fey" "Amy Poehler" "test.doc"```

It shouldn't work, because authors cannot submit the same manuscript twice.

Log out: ```logout```


#### Publish a manuscript
Now, to test the editor functions, let us go through the process of publishing a manuscript, from beginning to end.

Log in to azizansari's account: ```login editor azizansari```

You should be able to see the number of manuscripts in each stage (the status command).  Now, use the list command to see a more detailed overview of the manuscripts associated with this editor: ```list```

We should see a manuscript called "Hog and Pig" with an ID of 1.  Let us try assigning this manuscript to a reviewer whose username is omarbennett: ```assign 1 omarbennett```

The system should tell us that we cannot assign this manuscript to omarbennett because he does not have an RI code that matches the RI code of this manuscript.

Now, let us try assigning a manuscript that is not ours to assign: ```assign 5 omarbennett```

The system should say that we do not have the power to do this because the manuscript is either not ours or is past the review stage.

Now, let us try to accept manuscript 1: ```accept 1```

The system should tell us that there must be 3 completed reviews before we can accept the manuscript.

Let us assign 3 reviewers to review this manuscript:

```assign 1 reaganmcknight```

```assign 1 kevinfrazier```

```assign 1 amalwaters```

Let us try to assign the manuscript to one of the people twice: ```assign 1 reaganmcknight```

The system should say that the reviewer has already been assigned the manuscript.

Now, let us check the status of our editor: ```status```

Let us check the list of our editor: ```list```

We should see that the ```status``` command outputs one more manuscript as being under review, and the ```list``` command shows that manuscript 1 is now "Under Review."

Let us logout of this editor's account: ```logout```


#### Review a manuscript
Log in to reviewer reaganmcknight's account: ```login reviewer reaganmcknight```

Check the detailed list of her assigned reviews: ```list```

We should see manuscript 1.  Let us review manuscript 1: ```review accept 1 9 9 9 9```

Let us try reviewing a manuscript that is not reaganmcknight's: ```review accept 7 9 9 9 9```

The system should tell us that we have not been assigned to this manuscript.

Let us also try reviewing a manuscript that is not under review: ```review accept 4 9 9 9 9```

The system should tell us that this manuscript is not under review at the moment.

Let us now log out of reaganmcknight's account: ```logout```

Please log in to kevinfrazier's account: ```login reviewer kevinfrazier```

Check the detailed list of his assigned reviews: ```list```

We should see manuscript 1.  Let us review manuscript 1: ```review accept 1 8 8 9 7```

Let us now log out of kevinfrazier's account: ```logout```

Please log in to amalwaters's account: ```login reviewer amalwaters```

Check the detailed list of her assigned reviews: ```list```

We should see manuscript 1.  Let us review manuscript 1: ```review accept 1 7 8 9 7```

Let us now log out of amalwaters's account: ```logout```


#### Publish a manuscript (cont.)
Now, let us go back to the editor commands.  Please log in to azizansari's account: ```login editor azizansari```

Let us accept manuscript 1: ```accept 1```

If we use the list command, we can see that the status has changed: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Let us reject one of the other manuscripts: ```reject 7```

Once again, if we use the list command, we can see that the status has changed: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Let us now try typesetting the manuscript to 20 pages: ```typeset 1 20```

Once again, if we use the list command, we can see that the status has changed: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Let us try typesetting a manuscript under review: ```typeset 3 2```

The system should tell us that the manuscript is not in the appropriate stage to be typeset or that the editor is not associated with the manuscript.

Let us now try scheduling our manuscript: ```schedule 1 2017 1```

The system should tell us that this would exceed the page limit.

Let us now try scheduling our manuscript for a different issue: ``schedule 1 2017 3```

Once again, if we use the list command, we can see that the status has changed: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Now, let us finally publish the journal: ```publish 2017 3```

Once again, if we use the list command, we can see that the status has changed: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Let us try rejecting a published manuscript: ```reject 1```

The system should tell us that this is not possible because the editor is either not associated or because the manuscript is beyond rejection.

Let us now log out of the editor account: ```logout```

Let us log back in to a reviewer's account to see the status change: ```login reviewer reaganmcknight```

Once again, if we use the list command, we can see that the status of manuscript 1 has changed to published: ```list```

We can also use the status command: ```status```

Let us log out of the reviewer's account: ```logout```

We have now successfully taken a manuscript through the publication process!


#### Other functions
Let us log in to reedconrad's account: ```login author reedconrad```

Let us see the detailed list of the author's manuscripts: ```list```

Let us try to retract a published manuscript: ```retract 1```

The system should not allow this and tell us that the manuscript is either not ours or has already been published.

Let us try to retract a manuscript under review: ```retract 3``` (answer yes)

Let us see the detailed list of the author's manuscripts: ```list```

Manuscript 3 should be gone.

Let us try assigning a review from this author's account: ```assign 9 reaganmcknight```

The system should say that only editors can assign reviews.

Let us try to log in to another account without logging out: ```login editor azizansari```

The system should tell us that we need to logout before logging in again.

Let us log out of reedconrad's account: ```logout```

Let us log in to reviewer reaganmcknight's account: ```login reviewer reaganmcknight```

Let us have reaganmcknight resign: ```retire```

If we try to use the list command, we see that we have been automatically logged out: ```list```

Now, let us log in to editor merylstreep's account: ```login editor merylstreep```

Let us list her manuscripts in detail: ```list```

Let us try to assign manuscript 11 to our retired reviewer reaganmcknight: ```assign 11 reaganmcknight```

The system should tell us that the reviewer has retired.

Let us now logout: ```logout```

If you wish, you may end the program by using the "quit" command: ```quit```
